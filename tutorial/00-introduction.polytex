\chapter{About this book}

%include 00-introduction.polytex.date

\textbf{Disclaimer.}
\\
This was a work in progress.
The author has ceased active involvement with Mercury
and there are (currently) no plans to continue work on it.

\textbf{What is this book for?}
\\
A basis for courses teaching or using Mercury.  A tutorial for
experienced programmers wishing to learn Mercury.

\textbf{What version of Mercury is used in the book?}
\\
Any recent release-of-the-day (ROTD) compiler will do.  The text as of today
(10 April 2005) will work fine for Mercury release 0.12.

\textbf{Who is it aimed at?}
\\
Students who have completed at least one year of a computer science
degree, been exposed to a strongly, statically typed functional programming
language (\eg ML, Haskell, Miranda), and have some reasonable programming
experience.

\textbf{What is this book about?}
\\
This book is a tutorial on programming in Mercury.  The book should
provide the reader with enough information to become a competent Mercury
programmer and knowledge sufficient to understand the Mercury Reference
Manual, the Mercury Library Reference Manual and the Mercury Users' Guide.
The book will describe key features of Mercury in detail, including the type
system, the mode and determinism systems, and programming with
nondeterminism.

\textbf{What is this book not about?}
\\
This book will not teach you how to program in general, nor will it teach
you a great deal of theory.  It will not teach you how type inference works;
it will (probably) not teach you about Herbrand universes; it will not
include an extended treatise on IO in declarative programming languages; it
will not (in the first place) cover black-belt Mercury programming
techniques (e.g. dynamic type casts for non-ground types).

\textbf{Where is the introduction?}
\\
I plan to write the introduction last.  It will include a brief description
of ``what Mercury is all about'' and an explanation of what the book is
trying to do.

%\textbf{Where should I send comments?}
%\\
%Please subscribe to the Mercury users' mailing list by sending an e-mail
%containing the word ``subscribe'' in the body (as opposed to the subject
%line) to #mercury-users-request@cs.mu.oz.au# (this is a very low bandwidth
%mailing list).  Then you can send comments to #mercury-users@cs.mu.oz.au#.
%All feedback is very gratefully received, particularly with reference to
%missing topics.
